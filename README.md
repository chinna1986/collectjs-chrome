###CollectJS

A Chrome extension that allows you to get information necessary to crawl a page.
Originally project was at https://github.com/psherman/collectjs, but transitioning over to an extension from a bookmarklet for ease of use.
Still a work in progress, but most of the project is at a usable level.
